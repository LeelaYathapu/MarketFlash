## Database Design and Approach
Normalisation of Relational model to 3NF

1. First Normal Form (1NF): 
Each table has a primary key and all fields contain atomic values.

2. 	Second Normal Form (2NF): 
The model is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.

3.      Third Normal Form (3NF): 
The model is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key and reduce redundancy if any.

## Data Preparation for Tableau
Data Cleanup

1. Streamline Data Preparation: During data preparation, hide intermediary columns that are used for calculations or transformations but are not needed in the final visualization.

2. Focus on Relevant Data: Hiding irrelevant columns help to focus on cleaning and preparing only the data that will be used in analysis.
